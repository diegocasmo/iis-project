\section{Conclusion}

From a sparse dataset we have created a classifier which uses PCA dimensionality reduction and a SVM to classify landmark points from a depth camera. An admissible accuracy was achieved through trials of trying different preprocessing methods, dimensionality reduction, and classifier models.

\subsection{Ethical Concerns}
We need to look no further than science fiction for reasons for pause about fully developing emotional systems. The 2012 film "Prometheus" by Ridley Scott, features an android named David who's ulterior motives ability to lie kill the vast majority of the human characters. On the opposite end of this spectrum, the 2013 film "Her" features a fully developed relationship between a human and a non-corporeal artificial digital assistant, Samantha. The primary difference between David and Samantha is one is physical and the other is digital, by extension one has real-world autonomy and the other does not. No matter how much processing power Samantha has, she cannot lift a pebble on her own. Despite this, their capability to manipulate and evoke a spectrum of emotions --from anger to love-- is equal. Feelings are real and we should be careful developing artificial systems which can manipulate them.
