\section{Conclusion}

From a sparse dataset we have created a classifier which uses PCA dimensionality reduction and a SVM to classify landmark points from a depth camera. An admissible accuracy was achieved through trials of trying different preprocessing methods, dimensionality reduction, and classifier models.

\subsection{Ethical Concerns}
We need to look no further than science fiction for reasons to have pause about fully developing emotional systems. The 2012 film "Prometheus" by Ridley Scott, features an android named David who's ulterior motives kill the vast majority of the human characters. On the opposite end of this spectrum, the 2013 film "Her" features a fully developed relationship between a human and Samantha, a non-corporeal artificial digital assistant. The difference between these two is autonomy. No matter how much computing power Samantha has, it could never move a pebble on its own. David, however, is indistinguishable from humans and exerts even more strength than the strongest human characters.

There are no reasons as to why we should be trying to make robots look like humans no more than we should be trying to make dogs look like humans.

Feelings are nevertheless real and we should be careful developing artificial systems which can manipulate those emotions.
