\section{Results}

Each subsection here is dedicated to a method and is accompanied with two confusion matrices for \tsne and PCA each. The matrix is from a single run of the model. Results are otherwise measured by running the model 100 times on different random splits of data which has been preprocessed with PCA methods discussed in implementation. From these runs we can extract the average accuracy and standard deviation for each model and determine the best one.

\subsection{kNN}

With KNN methods we can attain an average accuracy of $47.3\%$ with a standard deviation of $0.045$, this is less than mediocre. This difference in accuracy compared to other methods can be thought of as a problem with clustering and the nature of the landmark points. Any set of emotions where, for example an eyebrow point is more or less the same point (e.g. surprised), will be classified by kNN as the same emotion, no other points will be taken into account. Among our labels are two super-categories of emotions, positive (happy, surprised) and negative (fear, angry, disgust, sad). The reader is invited to make those emotions with his or her face and take note the placement of their eyebrows. They may notice they are in the same place for each emotion, other features may be in the same place too.

We ran another experiment to demonstrate that KNN can detect these distinctions. Simply by running the dataset through the KNN classifier and counting how many positive and negative emotions it accurately detects. The results are telling, we can classify positive emotions with 67\% accuracy and negative emotions with 91\% accuracy.

\subsection{MLP}

With MLP methods we can attain an accuracy of $73.3\%$ with a standard deviation of $0.037$. This is great.

\subsection{Random Forests}

\twoupfigure{pca-rf}{tsne-rf}{Confustion matrices for RF.}{PCA}{\tsne}{rf-conf}

With RF methods we can attain an accuracy of $62.9\%$ with a standard deviation of $0.040$. While consistent, it is still about 10\% less accurate than the competing supervised methods.

\subsection{SVM}

\twoupfigure{pca-svm}{tsne-svm}{Confustion matrices for SVM.}{PCA}{\tsne}{svm-conf}

With SVM methods we get an accuracy of $74.00\%$ with a standard deviation of $0.039$. To a marginal detriment of consistency with MLP methods, this makes it the most accurate model.
