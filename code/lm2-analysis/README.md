# ``.lm2`` Features Analysis

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks which use the ``.lm2``features to attempt to correctly classify the data in the Bosphorus database. Each Jupyter notebook is named after the classifier implemented inside of it; k-Nearest Neighbors (=``lm2-knn.ipynb``), Support Vector Machine (=``lm2-svm.ipynb``), Multilayer Perceptron (=``lm2-mlp.ipynb``), and Random Forest (=``lm2-rf.ipynb``).

## Instructions
  - Make sure the ``.lm2`` parser has been executed (instructions in [../../parsers](../../parsers))
  - Open desired Jupyter notebook and execute it
