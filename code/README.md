# Analysis and Classification of The Bosphorus Database

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks which use the ``.lm2`` and ``.lm3`` features to attempt to correctly classify the data in the Bosphorus database. A total of four classifiers were implemented; k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest. For each of these classifiers different feature transformation, regularization, and validation techniques are used to identify which setup performs best.
