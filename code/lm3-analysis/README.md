# ``.lm3`` Features Analysis

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks which use the ``.lm3``features to attempt to correctly classify the data in the Bosphorus database. Each Jupyter notebook is named after the classifier implemented inside of it; k-Nearest Neighbors (=``lm3-knn.ipynb``), Support Vector Machine (=``lm3-svm.ipynb``), Multilayer Perceptron (=``lm3-mlp.ipynb``), and Random Forest (=``lm3-rf.ipynb``).

## Instructions
  - Make sure the ``.lm3`` parser has been executed ( instructions in [./parsers/README.md](./parsers/README.md))
  - Open desired Jupyter notebook and execute it
