# ``.lm3`` Features Analysis

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks which use the ``.lm3``features to attempt to correctly classify the data in the Bosphorus database. Each Jupyter notebook is named after the classifier implemented inside of it; k-Nearest Neighbors (=``knn.ipynb``), Support Vector Machine (=``svm.ipynb``), Multilayer Perceptron (=``mlp.ipynb``), and Random Forest (=``random-forest.ipynb``).

## Instructions
  - Make sure the ``.lm3`` parser has been executed ( instructions in [./parsers/README.md](./parsers/README.md))
  - Open desired Jupyter notebook and execute it
