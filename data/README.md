# Instructions

Datasets are not included in the repository since their size is too large (both their ``.zip`` and uncompressed files have been added to the ``.gitignore`` file). Regardless of that, it all should work fine as long as all the dataset required files are uncompressed in this directory with no modification to their file names.
